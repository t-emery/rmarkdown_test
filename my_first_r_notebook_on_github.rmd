```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(plotly)
library(DT)
```

This is my first R Notebook that I'm going to publish on Github as proof of concept.


# Table

I'm using the DT packge to display the data from the built-in data set `economics`

```{r}
data(economics)
DT::datatable(economics)
```

# Plot
```{r}
economics %>%
        plot_ly(x = ~date, y = ~pce) %>%
        add_lines()
```
